The first is to system-\natically generate candidate subgraphs. We use edge-growth as the basic mechanism for\nextending the candidates. The mining process proceeds in a breadth-first (level-wise)\nor a depth-first manner, starting with an empty subgraph (i.e., with no edge), and\nadding a new edge each time. Such an edge may either connect two existing vertices\nin the graph or it may introduce a new vertex as one end of a new edge. The key is\nto perform nonredundant subgraph enumeration, such\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddea Paper Context\n\n- **Machine Learning Potential Repository**\nThis paper introduces a machine learning potential repository that includes\nPareto optimal machine learning potentials. It also shows the systematic\ndevelopment of accurate and fast machine learning potentials for a wide range\nof elemental systems. As a result, many Pareto optimal machine learning\npotentials are available in the repository from a website. Therefore, the\nrepository will help many scientists to perform accurate and fast atomistic\nsimulations.\n\n- **Bayesian Optimization for Machine Learning : A Practical Guidebook**\nThe engineering of machine learning systems is still a nascent field; relying\non a seemingly daunting collection of quickly evolving tools and best\npractices. It is our hope that this guidebook will serve as a useful resource\nfor machine learning practitioners looking to take advantage of Bayesian\noptimization techniques. We outline four example machine learning problems that\ncan be solved using open source machine learning libraries, and highlight the\nbenefits of using Bayesian optimization in the context of these common machine\nlearning applications.\n\n- **Position Paper: Towards Transparent Machine Learning**\nTransparent machine learning is introduced as an alternative form of machine\nlearning, where both the model and the learning system are represented in\nsource code form. The goal of this project is to enable direct human\nunderstanding of machine learning models, giving us the ability to learn,\nverify, and refine them as programs. If solved, this technology could represent\na best-case scenario for the safety and security of AI systems going forward.\n\n- **A Machine Learning Tutorial for Operational Meteorology, Part I: Traditional Machine Learning**\nRecently, the use of machine learning in meteorology has increased greatly.\nWhile many machine learning methods are not new, university classes on machine\nlearning are largely unavailable to meteorology students and are not required\nto become a meteorologist. The lack of formal instruction has contributed to\nperception that machine learning methods are 'black boxes' and thus end-users\nare hesitant to apply the machine learning methods in their every day workflow.\nTo reduce the opaqueness of machine learning methods and lower hesitancy\ntowards machine learning in meteorology, this paper provides a survey of some\nof the most common machine learning methods. A familiar meteorological example\nis used to contextualize the machine learning methods while also discussing\nmachine learning topics using plain language. The following machine learning\nmethods are demonstrated: linear regression; logistic regression; decision\ntrees; random forest; gradient boosted decision trees; naive Bayes; and support\nvector machines. Beyond discussing the different methods, the paper also\ncontains discussions on the general machine learning process as well as best\npractices to enable readers to apply machine learning to their own datasets.\nFurthermore, all code (in the form of Jupyter notebooks and Google Colaboratory\nnotebooks) used to make the examples in the paper is provided in an effort to\ncatalyse the use of machine learning in meteorology.\n\n- **Joint Training of Deep Boltzmann Machines**\nWe introduce a new method for training deep Boltzmann machines jointly. Prior\nmethods require an initial learning pass that trains the deep Boltzmann machine\ngreedily, one layer at a time, or do not perform well on classifi- cation\ntasks.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf10 Wikipedia Summary\n\nThe 1999 London nail bombings were a series of bomb explosions in London, England. Over three successive weekends between 17 and 30 April 1999, homemade nail bombs were detonated in Brixton in South London; at Brick Lane, Spitalfields, in the East End; and at the Admiral Duncan pub in Soho in the West End. Each bomb contained up to 1,500 100 mm nails, in duffel bags that were left in public spaces. The bombs killed three people and injured 140 people, four of whom lost limbs.\nOn 2 May 1999, the Metropolitan Police Anti-Terrorist Branch charged 22-year-old David Copeland with murder.\n"
