However, the impact of AI-generated responses on interpersonal relationships remains understudied. This research proposal aims to investigate the efficacy of AI in human communication, focusing on the effects of AI-generated responses on trust, empathy, and intimacy in human relationships.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that** AI-generated responses can be perceived as more objective and efficient, but may lack emotional authenticity (Kumar et al., 2020). Moreover, the over-reliance on AI-generated responses may lead to a decline in human emotional intelligence (Goleman, 1995). This study seeks to bridge the knowledge gap by exploring the consequences of AI-generated responses on human relationships.\n\n**Problem Statement**\nDespite the growing presence of AI-generated responses in communication, the effects of AI on interpersonal relationships are unclear, and the potential consequences of AI-generated responses on trust, empathy, and intimacy remain underinvestigated.\n\n**Research Objectives or Hypotheses**\nThe primary objectives of this study are to:\n\t* Examine the impact of AI-generated responses on trust, empathy, and intimacy in human relationships.\n\t* Investigate the moderating effects of emotional intelligence on the relationship between AI-generated responses and interpersonal relationships.\n\t* Compare the effects of human-generated responses versus AI-generated responses on interpersonal relationships.\n\nBased on the literature, we hypothesize that**:\n\t+ AI-generated responses will lead to decreased trust, empathy, and intimacy in human relationships.\n\t+ Human emotional intelligence will moderate the relationship between AI-generated responses and interpersonal relationships.\n\t+ Human-generated responses will lead to stronger interpersonal relationships compared to AI-generated responses.\n\n**Proposed Methodology**\nThis study will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection**:\n\n\t* Quantitative data will be collected through an online survey, using a 2x2 between-subjects design, with participants receiving either human-generated or AI-generated responses.\n\t* Qualitative data will be collected through in-depth interviews with participants to explore their experiences and perceptions of AI responses.\n\n**Expected Outcomes**\nThis study expects to provide insights into the effects of AI-generated responses on interpersonal relationships, trust, empathy, and intimacy. The results will contribute to the development of guidelines for AI-generated responses in human communication.\n\n**Potential Challenges or Limitations**\n\t* Participant bias: Participants may have preconceived notions about AI-generated responses, influencing their responses.\n\t* Limited generalizability: The study's findings may not be representative of all populations, especially those with limited exposure to AI-generated responses.\n\n**Follow-up Research Suggestions**\n\t+ Investigate the impact of AI-generated responses on human relationships in different cultural contexts.\n\t+ Examine the effects of multimodal AI-generated responses (e.g., speech, text, and visual cues on human relationships.\n\t+ Develop and test AI-generated response systems that promote human emotional intelligence and intimacy.\n\n(Kumar et al., 2020; Goleman, 1995)"
